    "message": "Snowflake is a system that <strong>allows people from all over the world to access censored websites and applications</strong>. Similar to how VPNs assist users in getting around Internet censorship, Snowflake helps you avoid being noticed by Internet censors by making your Internet activity appear as though you're using the Internet for a regular video or voice call."

    "message": "There are numerous tools available, such as Snowflake, that \"transform\" Internet activity, each using a different technique. Some redirect Internet traffic to appear to be coming from popular cloud providers like Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services. Others scramble Internet traffic in order to make it appear completely random."
